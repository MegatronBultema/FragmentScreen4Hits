Project Option 1:
High level description:
I will develop a predictive algorithm to determine the likelihood of small molecule inhibitors
to the human protein target MTH1. The predictive algorithm will be trained on molecule fragment screening analysis including the molecule fingerprint descriptors, _____, and hit scoring. Prediction of small molecule inhibition likelihood will reduce time and cost associated with high-throughput screening of inhibitors towards the human protein target MTH1 as effective cancer treatments.

Presentation:
Ideally I would build a web app that would take in a small molecule screening library and return as csv with the scored molecules. The web app would show the top 5 hits and highlight the portion(s) (features) of the molecule that contributed to the high score.

Next Step:
I have trained a Random Forest Classifier with a portion of the fragment screening data however I have imbalanced classes with only 9% of the molecule fragments resulting in inhibition hits towards the target.
My next step is to deal with the imbalance. I will try weighting first then oversampling of the under represented class. I do not think SMOTE will work for the feature matrix I am working with. The I want to try non-negative matrix factorization (or PCA, or SVD) to look at the feature space. I plan to try Logistic Regression, SVM, and RandomForestClassifier models.
